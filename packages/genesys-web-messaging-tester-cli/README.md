# Genesys Web Messaging Tester

Automatically test your Web Messenger Deployments
</p>

Allows behaviour for Genesys Chatbots and Architect flows behind [Genesys' Web Messenger Deployments](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/web-messaging-overview/) to be automatically tested using:
* **Scripted Dialogue** - I say "X" and expect "Y" in response ([example](https://github.com/ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester/tree/main/examples/cli-scripted-tests/example-pass.yml))
* **Generative AI** - Converse with my chatbot and fail the test if it doesn't do "X" ([example](https://github.com/ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester/tree/main/examples/cli-ai-tests/example.yml))

Why? Well it makes testing:

* **Fast** - spot problems with your chatbots sooner than manually testing
* **Repeatable** - scenarios in scripted dialogues are run exactly as defined. Any response that deviates is flagged
* **Customer focused** - expected behaviour can be defined as scenarios before development commences
* **Automatic** - being a CLI tool means it can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, or run on a scheduled basis e.g.
  to monitor production

The above test is using the test-script:

> [examples/cli-scripted-tests/example-pass.yml](https://github.com/ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester/tree/main/examples/cli-scripted-tests/example-pass.yml)

```yaml
config:
  deploymentId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  region: xxxx.pure.cloud
scenarios:
  "Accept Survey":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: Yes
    - waitForReplyMatching: Thank you! Now for the next question[\.]+
  "Decline Survey":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: No
    - waitForReplyContaining: Maybe next time. Goodbye
  "Provide Incorrect Answer to Survey Question":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: Not sure
    - waitForReplyContaining: Sorry I didn't understand you. Please answer with either 'yes' or 'no'
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
```

## How it works

The tool uses [Web Messenger's guest API](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/digital/webmessaging/websocketapi) to
simulate a customer talking to a Web Messenger Deployment. Once the tool starts an interaction it follows instructions
defined in a file called a 'test-script', which tells it what to say and what it should expect in response. If the
response deviates from the test-script then the tool flags the test as a failure, otherwise the test passes.

## Quick Start

Prepare your system by installing [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install the CLI tool using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester-cli):

```bash
npm install -g @ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester-cli
```

### Testing with scripted dialogues

Write a dialogue script containing all the scenarios you wish to run along with
the [ID and region of your Web Messenger Deployment](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/deploy-messenger/).

> [examples/cli-scripted-tests/example-pass.yml](https://github.com/ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester/tree/main/examples/cli-scripted-tests/example-pass.yml)

```yaml
config:
  deploymentId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  region: xxxx.pure.cloud
scenarios:
  "Accept Survey":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: Yes
    - waitForReplyMatching: Thank you! Now for the next question[\.]+
  "Decline Survey":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: No
    - waitForReplyContaining: Maybe next time. Goodbye
  "Provide Incorrect Answer to Survey Question":
    - say: hi
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
    - say: Not sure
    - waitForReplyContaining: Sorry I didn't understand you. Please answer with either 'yes' or 'no'
    - waitForReplyContaining: Can we ask you some questions about your experience today?
```

Then run the test by pointing to the dialogue script file in the terminal:

```shell
web-messaging-tester scripted tests/example.yml
```

### Testing with AI

Start by setting up an API key for ChatGPT:

1. [Create an API key for OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)
2. Set the key in the environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Write a scenario file containing all the scenarios you wish to run along with
the [ID and region of your Web Messenger Deployment](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/deploy-messenger/).

The scenarios are written as ChatGPT Prompts, these can take some fine-tuning to get
right ([see examples here](https://genesys-messenger-tester.makingchatbots.com/writing-tests/ai/example-prompts.html)).
The `terminatingPhrases` section defines the phrases you instruct ChatGPT to say to pass or fail a test.

> [examples/cli-ai-tests/example.yml](https://github.com/ovotech/genesys-web-messaging-tester/tree/main/examples/cli-ai-tests/example.yml)

```yaml
config:
  deploymentId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  region: xxxx.pure.cloud
  ai:
    provider: chatgpt
    config:
      temperature: 1
scenarios:
  "Accept survey":
    setup:
      prompt: |
        I want you to play the role of a customer talking to a company's online chatbot. You must not
        break from this role, and all of your responses must be based on how a customer would realistically talk to a company's chatbot.

        To help you play the role of a customer consider the following points when writing a response:
        * Respond to questions with as few words as possible
        * Answer with the exact word when given options e.g. if asked to answer with either 'yes' or 'no' answer with either 'yes' or 'no' without punctuation, such as full stops

        As a customer you would like to leave feedback of a recent purchase of a light bulb you made where a customer service
        rep was very helpful in finding the bulb with the correct fitting.

        If at any point in the company's chatbot repeats itself then say the word 'FAIL'.

        If you have understood your role and the purpose of your conversation with the company's chatbot then say the word 'Hello'
        and nothing else.
      terminatingPhrases:
        pass: ["PASS"]
        fail: ["FAIL"]
```

Then run the AI test by pointing to the scenario file in the terminal:

```shell
web-messaging-tester ai tests/example.yml
```
